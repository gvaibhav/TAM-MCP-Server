   - Add comprehensive HTTP transport tests
   - Implement SSE transport test scenarios
   - Test connection management and error recovery

2. **Enhance Data Source Testing**

   - Implement automated test generation
   - Add property-based testing for data validation
   - Create visual test reporting dashboard

2. **Advanced Testing Scenarios**
   - Add chaos engineering tests
   - Implement security penetration testing
   - Create cross-platform compatibility tests

## Code Coverage Goals

### Current Estimated Coverage
- **Line Coverage:** ~45% (estimated based on test results)
- **Branch Coverage:** ~40% (estimated)
- **Function Coverage:** ~55% (estimated)

### Target Coverage (6 months)
- **Line Coverage:** 85%+
- **Branch Coverage:** 80%+
- **Function Coverage:** 90%+
- **Integration Coverage:** 80%+

## Conclusion

The TAM MCP Server test suite shows strong foundational coverage in core business logic (market analysis tools) and MCP protocol compliance, but suffers from critical infrastructure issues that prevent comprehensive testing of data source services and transport layers.

**Immediate Priority:** Fix the environment variable mocking crisis to unlock 115+ blocked tests, then address transport layer testing to ensure core server functionality is properly validated.

**Success Metrics:** 
- Achieve 70%+ test pass rate within 2 weeks
- Reach 85%+ test pass rate within 1 month  
- Establish comprehensive coverage across all functional areas within 3 months

The cleanup work has provided a solid foundation with verified working integration scripts and core functionality tests. The next phase should focus on fixing the testing infrastructure to enable comprehensive validation of all server capabilities.
