# Documentation Alignment Summary
## TAM MCP Server: Correcting Design vs Implementation Discrepancies

**Date**: June 13, 2025  
**Purpose**: Address critical documentation misalignment identified in implementation review

---

## 🎯 Issue Addressed

**Critical Finding**: The design documentation described a tool set that didn't match the actual implementation, causing confusion for users and developers.

**Root Cause**: The project evolved beyond its original design, implementing a sophisticated dual tool system that wasn't properly documented.
