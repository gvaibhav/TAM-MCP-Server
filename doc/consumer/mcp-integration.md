# MCP Client Integration

## Overview

The TAM MCP Server implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for seamless integration with AI models and applications.

## Supported Transports

### 1. STDIO Transport (Recommended)
Best for direct integration with MCP clients like Claude Desktop.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tam-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@gvaibhav/tam-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. HTTP Transport
For web applications and REST API integrations.

```bash
# Start HTTP server
npm run start:http

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Server-Sent Events (SSE)
For real-time streaming applications.

```bash
# Start SSE server  
npm run start:sse

# Connect to real-time events
```
