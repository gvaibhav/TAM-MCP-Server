    *   `sources?`: string[] (optional) - Array of specific data source IDs (e.g., `["CENSUS", "BLS", "WORLD_BANK"]`) to restrict the search. If omitted, queries all enabled and relevant sources.
    *   `limit?`: number (optional) - Maximum number of consolidated industry results to return.
    *   `minRelevanceScore?`: number (optional, 0.0 to 1.0) - Minimum relevance score for results to be included.
    *   `geographyFilter?`: string[] (optional) - Array of geographic identifiers (e.g., ["US", "CA", "DE"]) to help focus the search, where applicable to underlying sources.
*   **Output:** JSON object containing:
    *   `query`: string - The original query string submitted.
    *   `parameters`: object - The parameters used for the search (including defaults if not specified).
    *   `results`: array of `IndustryDTO` objects. Each `IndustryDTO` represents a consolidated view of an industry and includes:
        *   `industryId`: string - A unique identifier for the industry (e.g., a primary NAICS code, or an internally generated ID for aggregated concepts).
        *   `name`: string - Common or standardized name of the industry.
        *   `description?`: string - A brief description or summary of the industry.
        *   `naicsCodes?`: string[] - Associated NAICS codes relevant to this industry entry.
        *   `sicCodes?`: string[] - Associated SIC codes, if available.
        *   `otherCodes?`: object[] - Other relevant industry classification codes (e.g., `{ "system": "ISIC", "code": "C2100" }`).
        *   `keywords?`: string[] - Relevant keywords or search terms associated with the industry.
        *   `marketSizeEstimate?`: object - An estimated market size, potentially aggregated or selected from the best available source. Structure: `{ "value": number, "currency": string, "year": string, "sourceExcerpt": string, "originalSource": string }`.
        *   `growthRate?`: object - Estimated growth rate. Structure: `{ "value": number, "period": "annual" | "quarterly", "year": string, "sourceExcerpt": string, "originalSource": string }`.
        *   `keyPlayers?`: string[] - List of key companies or entities in the industry.
        *   `trends?`: string[] - Notable trends observed in the industry.
        *   `dataSources`: array of objects - Details of the underlying data points from various sources that contributed to this consolidated DTO. Each object might include: `{ "sourceName": string, "sourceSpecificId": string, "dataType": string, "retrievedData": object, "retrievalTimestamp": string }`.
        *   `relevanceScore`: number - A score (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0) indicating the relevance of this consolidated entry to the original query.
        *   `lastUpdated?`: string (ISO 8601 date) - The most recent date an underlying data point for this entry was updated or reported by its source.
    *   `summary?`: string - An optional, brief textual summary of the overall findings or the top results.
    *   `errors?`: array of objects - Any errors encountered from specific data sources during the search process (e.g., `{ "sourceName": "AlphaVantage", "errorCode": "API_TIMEOUT", "message": "..." }`).
*   **Logic:**
    1.  Validates input parameters (`query`, `sources`, `limit`, `minRelevanceScore`, `geographyFilter`).
    2.  Calls `DataService.searchIndustries()` with the validated parameters. This is the core method responsible for orchestration.
    3.  The `DataService.searchIndustries()` method performs the following:
        *   **Multi-Source Search Strategy:** Concurrently queries enabled and relevant data sources (Alpha Vantage, Census, FRED, World Bank, BLS, Nasdaq, OECD, IMF, and potentially mock/static data providers). The selection of sources can be guided by the `sources` parameter or an internal logic that maps query types/keywords to appropriate data providers. Each data source service has specific query mapping logic (e.g., interpreting the main `query` for NAICS codes for Census, keywords for BLS, stock symbols/company names for Alpha Vantage, economic indicators for FRED/World Bank, etc.). The `geographyFilter` is used to refine queries to individual data sources where applicable.
        *   **Data Consolidation & Deduplication:** Results from various sources are transformed into a common `Industry` Data Transfer Object (DTO) schema. Sophisticated deduplication logic is applied based on NAICS codes, industry names, geographic scope, and other identifying factors to avoid redundant entries and to merge information about the same conceptual industry from different sources into a single, richer DTO.
        *   **Relevance Scoring and Ranking:** Consolidated `IndustryDTOs` are scored based on factors suchas: direct keyword matches in names or descriptions, the specificity of NAICS/other code matches, the completeness and quality of the data returned for an industry, the perceived reliability or directness of the data source for the query type, and the recency of the data. Results are then ranked by this relevance score.
        *   **Result Filtering & Limiting:** Applies the `limit` and `minRelevanceScore` parameters to the ranked list of results.
        *   **Fallback Mechanisms & Error Handling:** If live data sources fail, time out, or return no data, the system logs these errors (to be included in the tool's output). The search attempts to continue with other available sources. Caching is employed at both the `DataService` level (for potentially aggregated/transformed results) and at individual data source service levels (for raw API responses) to improve performance, reduce load on external APIs, and provide resilience. Mock data might be used as a fallback for certain queries if configured and primary sources are unavailable.
    4.  The `industry_search` tool receives the processed list of `IndustryDTOs`, summary, and error list from `DataService`.
    5.  Formats the final JSON response as specified in the "Output" section.

## 4. Backend Data Source Mapping

This section details how MCP tools map to underlying backend services and their methods.

*   **Direct Data Source Access Tools (Section 2.1):** Each tool in this category has a 1:1 mapping to a specific method within one of the 8 backend data source services (e.g., `alphaVantage_getCompanyOverview` maps to `AlphaVantageService.fetchMarketSize`). The tool acts as a direct pass-through for that service method, facilitated by the `DataService`, ensuring raw or minimally processed data is returned.

*   **Multi-Source Search and Aggregation Tools (Section 2.2):** These tools, such as `industry_search`, interact with multiple data source services. The `DataService` is responsible for orchestrating these interactions, calling relevant methods of individual data source services (e.g., `BlsService.fetchIndustryData`, `CensusService.searchNaics`, `AlphaVantageService.searchSymbols`), and then performing the necessary consolidation, deduplication, and ranking of results.

*   **Analytical and Calculation Tools (Section 2.3):** These tools typically invoke specific business logic methods within the `DataService` (e.g., `DataService.calculateTam`). These `DataService` methods might internally retrieve data using various data source services or perform calculations based on provided inputs and retrieved data.

## 6. Fallback Mechanisms (General)

The TAM MCP Server employs several strategies to ensure resilience and provide meaningful responses even when external data sources face issues.

### 6.1. Mock Data Usage
*   **Purpose:** To provide stable example responses for development, testing, and demonstrations, and as a last resort if live services are completely unavailable for critical information types.
*   **Activation:** Mock data providers can be enabled/disabled via configuration. The `industry_search` tool and potentially other tools might be configured to consult mock sources if primary live sources fail to return data or are explicitly disabled.
*   **Scope:** Mock data typically covers a predefined set of common queries or industry examples. It is not a comprehensive replacement for live data.
*   **Indication:** Responses containing mock data will be clearly flagged in the `dataSources` array of the `IndustryDTO` or in a similar metadata field to ensure transparency.

### 6.2. Error Handling
*   **Granular Errors:** Errors originating from individual data source services (e.g., API key issues, rate limits, source-specific errors, timeouts) are caught within the respective service modules (e.g., `AlphaVantageService`).
*   **Propagation to `DataService`:** These errors are typically logged by the specific service and then propagated to the `DataService`. The `DataService`, especially in multi-source operations like `searchIndustries`, will collect these errors without halting the entire operation. It will attempt to proceed with other available data sources.
*   **Tool-Level Reporting:** MCP tools (like `industry_search`) will receive a collection of errors from `DataService` and include them in their final response (e.g., in an `errors` array). This informs the client about which sources might have failed.
*   **Critical Failures:** If a fundamental issue occurs (e.g., `DataService` cannot operate, or a direct access tool's single source fails critically), the MCP tool will return a more general error response indicating the failure to process the request.
*   **User Feedback:** Error messages aim to be informative, providing context about the nature of the error and the source if applicable.

### 6.3. Caching Strategy
*   **Multi-Layer Caching:**
    *   **Data Source Service Cache:** Each individual data source service (e.g., `CensusService`, `BlsService`) implements its own caching layer. This cache stores the raw or minimally processed responses from the external API. This reduces redundant calls to the same external API endpoint with the same parameters.
        *   **TTL (Time-To-Live):** Cache entries have a configurable TTL. A shorter TTL is used for data that is expected to be volatile, while a longer TTL can be used for more static data. Separate TTLs are often configured for successful fetches versus "no data found" responses or error responses to prevent rapid retries on known issues.
    *   **`DataService` Cache (Optional/Future):** For complex, aggregated results (like those from `industry_search` or `market_size_calculator` before final DTO transformation), an additional caching layer within `DataService` could be implemented. This would store the consolidated data before it's passed to the tool, saving on repeated aggregation and processing logic if the same complex query is made.
*   **Cache Invalidation:** Cache invalidation is primarily TTL-based. Manual cache clearing mechanisms might be provided for administrative purposes.
*   **Cache Key Design:** Cache keys are carefully constructed to include all parameters that define the uniqueness of a request to an external API or an internal processing step.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   **Performance:** Significantly improves response times for repeated queries.
    *   **Rate Limit Management:** Reduces the number of calls to external APIs, helping to stay within rate limits.
    *   **Resilience:** Can serve stale data (if configured) when a live source is temporarily unavailable, providing a degree of fault tolerance.
    *   **Cost Reduction:** Lowers costs associated with pay-per-call APIs.

## 7. API Integration Points

This section details the integration specifics for each backend data source, including authentication, key management, rate limits, and primary endpoints utilized by the TAM MCP Server. API keys are expected to be stored in environment variables and accessed by their respective services.

### 7.1. Alpha Vantage
*   **Authentication:** API Key (`apikey` parameter in the query string).
*   **Key Management:** The API key is expected to be stored in an environment variable (e.g., `ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY`) and accessed by the `AlphaVantageService`.
*   **Rate Limits:** Free tier typically allows around 25 requests per day or 5 requests per minute. Premium tiers offer significantly higher limits (e.g., 75-1200+ requests per minute). *Actual limits should be verified based on the subscribed plan.*
*   **Primary Endpoints Used (Examples):**
    *   Company Overview: `https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=OVERVIEW&symbol={symbol}&apikey={process.env.ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY}`
    *   Time Series: `https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function={seriesType}&symbol={symbol}&outputsize={outputsize}&apikey={process.env.ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY}`
*   **Data Format:** JSON.
*   **Notes:** Endpoint usage depends on the `function` parameter (e.g., `OVERVIEW`, `TIME_SERIES_DAILY`).

### 7.2. U.S. Census Bureau
*   **Authentication:** API Key (`key` parameter in the query string) is recommended for higher rate limits and stability.
*   **Key Management:** The API key is expected to be stored in an environment variable (e.g., `CENSUS_API_KEY`) and accessed by the `CensusService`.
*   **Rate Limits:** Without a key, limits are typically around 500 queries per IP address per day. With a key, this can increase significantly (e.g., 10,000+ queries per day, subject to Census Bureau policies). *Actual limits should be verified.*
*   **Primary Endpoints Used (Example for County Business Patterns):**
    *   `https://api.census.gov/data/{year}/{datasetPath}?get={variables}&for={forGeography}&{filterParams}&key={process.env.CENSUS_API_KEY}`
    *   Example: `https://api.census.gov/data/2021/cbp?get=EMP,PAYANN,ESTAB&for=us:1&NAICS2017=23&key={CENSUS_API_KEY}`

### 7.3. Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
*   **Authentication:** API Key (`api_key` parameter in the query string).
*   **Key Management:** The API key is expected to be stored in an environment variable (e.g., `FRED_API_KEY`) and accessed by the `FredService`.
*   **Rate Limits:** Generally generous, often around 120 requests per minute per API key. *Actual limits should be confirmed with FRED API documentation.*
*   **Primary Endpoints Used (Example for Series Observations):**
    *   `https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id={seriesId}&api_key={process.env.FRED_API_KEY}&file_type=json&observation_start={startDate}&observation_end={endDate}`
*   **Data Format:** JSON.

### 7.4. World Bank
*   **Authentication:** No API key is strictly required for basic access to most indicators.
*   **Key Management:** N/A if no key is used.
*   **Rate Limits:** Public access is generally open but subject to "fair use." Limits can be around 2,000-10,000 requests per hour, but this can vary. *It's advisable to check the latest World Bank API terms.*
*   **Primary Endpoints Used (Example for Indicator Data):**
    *   `http://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/{countryCode}/indicator/{indicatorCode}?format=json&per_page={count}&date={dateRange}`
    *   Example: `http://api.worldbank.org/v2/country/US/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?format=json&per_page=10&date=2015:2020`
*   **Data Format:** JSON (returns an array where the second element typically contains the data array).

### 7.5. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
*   **Authentication:** API Key (registration key) is optional for API v1 (limited) but recommended/required for API v2 for higher limits and more features. Passed in the request payload for v2.
*   **Key Management:** The API key is expected to be stored in an environment variable (e.g., `BLS_API_KEY`) and accessed by the `BlsService`.
*   **Rate Limits:**
    *   Without key (or API v1): ~25 queries per day.
    *   With key (API v2): Up to 500 queries per day, 50 series IDs per query, 10 years of data per series ID per query. *Actual limits should be verified with BLS API documentation.*
*   **Primary Endpoints Used (API v2):**
    *   `https://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/` (POST request)
    *   Payload Example: `{ "seriesid": ["SERIES_ID_1", "SERIES_ID_2"], "startyear":"2020", "endyear":"2023", "registrationkey":"{process.env.BLS_API_KEY}" }`
*   **Data Format:** JSON.

### 7.6. Nasdaq Data Link (formerly Quandl)
*   **Authentication:** API Key (`api_key` parameter in the query string).
*   **Key Management:** The API key is expected to be stored in an environment variable (e.g., `NASDAQ_API_KEY`) and accessed by the `NasdaqDataService`.
*   **Rate Limits:** Free plan typically allows ~300 calls per day and 20,000 calls per month. Premium plans offer significantly higher limits. *Actual limits depend on the subscription plan and should be verified.*
*   **Primary Endpoints Used (Example for Dataset Time Series):**
    *   `https://data.nasdaq.com/api/v3/datasets/{databaseCode}/{datasetCode}/data.json?api_key={process.env.NASDAQ_API_KEY}&{additional_params}`
    *   Example: `https://data.nasdaq.com/api/v3/datasets/FRED/GDP/data.json?api_key={NASDAQ_API_KEY}&limit=1`
*   **Data Format:** JSON.

### 7.7. Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
*   **Authentication:** No API key is typically required for the SDMX-JSON API.
*   **Key Management:** N/A.
*   **Rate Limits:** While not always explicitly defined with hard numbers, APIs are subject to "fair use" policies. Excessive requests can lead to temporary throttling or blocking. *It's recommended to implement respectful polling and caching.*
*   **Primary Endpoints Used (Example for Dataset):**
    *   `https://sdmx.oecd.org/sdmx-json/data/{datasetId}/{filterExpression}/{agencyId}?startTime={startTime}&endTime={endTime}&dimensionAtObservation={dimensionAtObservation}`
    *   Example: `https://sdmx.oecd.org/sdmx-json/data/QNA/AUS.TOTAL.B1_GE.Q/all?startTime=2020-Q1&endTime=2023-Q4`
*   **Data Format:** SDMX-JSON.

### 7.8. International Monetary Fund (IMF)
*   **Authentication:** No API key is typically required for the SDMX-JSON API.
*   **Key Management:** N/A.
*   **Rate Limits:** Similar to OECD, IMF APIs are generally open but subject to "fair use." High-volume, unthrottled requests may be restricted. *Caching and considerate request patterns are advised.*
*   **Primary Endpoints Used (Example for Compact Data):**
    *   `http://dataservices.imf.org/REST/SDMX_JSON.svc/CompactData/{dataflowId}/{key}?startPeriod={startPeriod}&endPeriod={endPeriod}`
    *   Example: `http://dataservices.imf.org/REST/SDMX_JSON.svc/CompactData/IFS/A.US.NGDP_RPCH?startPeriod=2020&endPeriod=2023`
*   **Data Format:** SDMX-JSON.
