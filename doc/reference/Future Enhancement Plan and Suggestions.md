# Future Enhancement Plan for TAM MCP Server

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to bridge the gaps between the current TAM MCP Server implementation and the complete requirements specification. The plan has been revised to clearly distinguish between:

- **MCP Server Enhancements** - Features and improvements that fall within the scope of the MCP server's responsibilities
- **Host Application Features** - Capabilities that would typically be implemented by applications consuming the MCP server

All existing MCP server functionality will be preserved while adding new tools and data sources within the appropriate scope boundaries.

| Integration complexity delays timeline | Medium | High | Start with highest-value integrations; use adapter pattern for flexibility |
| Tool complexity exceeds MCP capabilities | Medium | Medium | Design tools to return raw data when appropriate; leave complex processing to host |
| Performance degrades with additional tools | High | Medium | Implement incremental performance testing; optimize critical paths first |

### Dependency Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Third-party API changes break integrations | High | Medium | Build abstraction layers; implement robust error handling |
| Premium data sources limit access | High | Low | Establish backup data sources; implement caching strategies |
| Open-source library deprecation | Medium | Low | Select mature libraries; fork critical dependencies if necessary |
| MCP protocol evolution | Medium | Low | Design for protocol version compatibility; monitor spec updates |
