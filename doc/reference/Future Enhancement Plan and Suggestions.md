# Future Enhancement Plan for TAM MCP Server

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to bridge the gaps between the current TAM MCP Server implementation and the complete requirements specification. The plan has been revised to clearly distinguish between:

## Conclusion

This enhancement plan provides a focused roadmap for evolving the TAM MCP Server using freely available data sources under the MIT license. The plan clearly distinguishes between current MIT-licensed scope and future enterprise features requiring paid data sources.

By implementing the core tools with free data sources, we can deliver substantial value while establishing a foundation for future enterprise enhancements. The MIT-licensed version will serve as both a standalone solution for basic market analysis and a demonstration of the platform's capabilities for potential enterprise adopters.

The phased approach allows for incremental delivery of value while managing risks and dependencies. Upon completion of the current scope, the TAM MCP Server will provide a functional market data service that host applications can leverage for market sizing and analysis.
