### December 7, 2024 - Free Data Sources Integration (Phase 1)

**Major Feature: Integration of Free Data Sources and Core Service Enhancements**

This update introduces the initial phase of integrating multiple free data sources to provide real-time market data, significantly enhancing the server's analytical capabilities. It also includes major updates to data handling, caching, and core service architecture.

#### 🔧 **New Data Source Integration Framework**
- **Data Source Abstraction**: Introduced `DataSourceService` interface (`src/types/dataSources.ts`) to standardize interactions with various external data providers.
- **Service Implementation Skeletons**: Created service classes for 8 free data sources within `src/services/dataSources/`:
    - `BlsService` (Bureau of Labor Statistics)
    - `CensusService` (Census Bureau)
    - `FredService` (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
    - `WorldBankService` (World Bank)
    - `OecdService` (OECD)
    - `ImfService` (IMF)
    - `AlphaVantageService` (Alpha Vantage)
    - `NasdaqDataService` (Nasdaq Data Link)
- **Initial Data Fetching**:
    - Implemented `fetchMarketSize` in `WorldBankService` to retrieve data (e.g., GDP) using the World Bank API.
    - Implemented `fetchMarketSize` in `FredService` to retrieve economic series data (e.g., GDP) using the FRED API.
- **Environment Configuration**: Added support for API keys for these services via `.env` variables (e.g., `FRED_API_KEY`, `BLS_API_KEY`).

#### ⚙️ **Enhanced Caching System**
- **Two-Tier Caching Strategy**:
    - **`CacheService` (`src/services/cache/cacheService.ts`)**: Implemented an in-memory cache with Time-To-Live (TTL) support for fast access to frequently used data.
    - **`PersistenceService` (`src/services/cache/persistenceService.ts`)**: Implemented a persistent cache layer using JSON files stored in the `.cache_data/` directory, allowing cached data to survive server restarts.
- **Cache Management**: Cache entries include timestamps and TTLs. Services now integrate with `CacheService` for getting and setting data.
- **Configuration**: Added `.cache_data/` to `.gitignore`.

#### 🔄 **Core Service Updates**
- **`DataService` Orchestration (`src/services/dataService.ts`)**:
    - Refactored `DataService` to act as an orchestrator for the new `DataSourceService` instances.
    - `getMarketSize` method now attempts to fetch data sequentially from implemented real data sources (`FredService`, `WorldBankService`) before falling back to mock data.
    - Standardized the return format of `getMarketSize` to an object: `{ value: number, source: string, details: any }`, providing data value, origin, and metadata.
- **`MarketAnalysisTools` Adaptation (`src/tools/market-tools.ts`)**:
    - Updated all relevant tool methods (e.g., `marketSize`, `tamCalculator`, `industryData`, `marketComparison`) to correctly parse the new `getMarketSize` response structure.
    - Tool responses now include information about the `source` of the market data (e.g., "FredService", "mock").

#### 📄 **Documentation Updates**
- **`README.md` Overhaul**:
    - Documented the newly integrated free data sources and their respective APIs.
    - Added detailed instructions for configuring API keys via `.env` variables.
    - Explained the new two-tier caching strategy (in-memory and persistent).
    - Updated the project structure diagram to reflect the new `services/cache`, `services/dataSources`, and `types` directories.
- **User Feedback Incorporation (Planned for next phase)**:
    - Plan to move API URLs and constants to a dedicated config file.
    - Plan to make cache TTLs configurable per data source via environment variables.

#### 📁 **Key Files Changed**
- `src/services/dataService.ts`: Major refactor for data source orchestration.
- `src/tools/market-tools.ts`: Adapted tools to new data structures.
- `src/services/cache/cacheService.ts`: New implementation.
- `src/services/cache/persistenceService.ts`: New implementation.
- `src/types/dataSources.ts`: New interface definitions.
- `src/types/cache.ts`: New type definitions.
- `src/services/dataSources/*Service.ts`: New service skeletons and initial implementations for WorldBank and FRED.
- `README.md`: Updated documentation.
- `.gitignore`: Added `.cache_data/`.
- `doc/RELEASE-NOTES.md`: This entry.

#### 🎯 **Benefits Achieved**
- **Real Data Integration**: Server can now fetch actual market data from World Bank and FRED APIs.
- **Extensibility**: Framework in place to easily implement data fetching for 6 other free data sources and future premium sources.
- **Improved Performance & API Usage**: Caching system reduces redundant API calls and speeds up responses for previously fetched data.
- **Enhanced Transparency**: Tool responses now indicate the source of the data.
- **Maintainability**: Clearer separation of concerns with dedicated services for data sources and caching.
- **Foundation for Future Work**: Sets the stage for comprehensive testing, full implementation of all data sources, and advanced features like data validation and cross-source comparison.
