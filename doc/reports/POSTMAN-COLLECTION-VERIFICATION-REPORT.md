## Key Issues Fixed

### 1. Health Check Test Logic

**Problem:** Test expected JSON-RPC structure for simple health endpoint  
**Solution:** Added URL-based detection to handle health check differently  
**Impact:** Health check now passes consistently  

### 2. Session Management

**Problem:** Session ID extraction failing in Newman (pm.request.name was undefined)  
**Solution:** Updated session extraction to use URL-based detection  
**Impact:** All subsequent API calls now work with proper session management  

### 3. Tool Name Alignment

**Problem:** Collection used `industry_search` but implementation uses `industry_analysis`  
**Solution:** Updated collection to match actual implementation  
**Impact:** Tool calls now succeed instead of returning "unknown tool" errors  

### 4. Invalid SSE Stream Test

**Problem:** Collection included GET /mcp with SSE headers (not per MCP spec)  
**Solution:** Removed invalid SSE stream test  
**Impact:** Tests no longer hang on invalid endpoint  

### 5. Test Execution Order

**Problem:** Session termination ran before prompt tests, causing failures  
**Solution:** Moved session management to end of test suite  
**Impact:** All prompts tests now run successfully with valid session  

## New Functionality Added

### Comprehensive Prompt Testing

Added full prompt testing capabilities to verify the MCP server's prompt generation features:

- **List Prompts Endpoint:** Verifies all available prompts are returned
- **Prompt Generation:** Tests complex prompt generation with arguments
- **Business Analysis Prompts:** Validates professional prompt templates for:
  - Startup funding pitches
  - Private equity research  
  - Corporate strategy development

## Technical Improvements

### Collection Structure

- Organized tests in logical order: Core → Tools → Resources → Prompts → Session Management
- Added proper request/response validation
- Improved error handling and test assertions

### Documentation Alignment

- Updated tool names to match implementation exactly
- Added descriptions that reflect actual functionality
- Ensured all test data uses realistic business scenarios

## Recommendations

### For Development Team

1. **Maintain Test Suite:** Run Newman tests after any API changes
2. **Extend Coverage:** Consider adding more prompt examples for different business scenarios
3. **Performance Monitoring:** Track response times for optimization opportunities

### For API Users

1. **Use Updated Collection:** New collection provides accurate API reference
2. **Session Management:** Properly handle session lifecycle in client applications
3. **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling for all API calls

## Files Modified

### Primary Changes

- `examples/TAM-MCP-Server-Postman-Collection.json` - Complete update and expansion

### Test Artifacts Created (Cleaned Up)

- Temporary test files removed from project root per CONTRIBUTING guidelines

## Conclusion

The Postman collection verification is complete and successful. The collection now provides comprehensive, accurate testing coverage for all TAM MCP Server capabilities. This enables reliable API testing, client development, and integration validation.

**Next Steps:**

- Collection is ready for production use
- Can be used for automated testing in CI/CD pipelines
- Serves as accurate API documentation for developers
