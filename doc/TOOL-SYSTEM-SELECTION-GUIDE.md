await client.callTool("bls_getSeriesData", { 
  seriesIds: ["LNS14000000"],
  startYear: "2022",
  endYear: "2024"
});

// Census industry statistics
await client.callTool("census_fetchIndustryData", {
  variables: "EMP,PAYANN",
  forGeography: "us:1",
  filterParams: { "NAICS2017": "541511" }
});
```

### Advantages

## Migration Guidelines

### From Data Access to Business Analysis
If you're currently using MCP Data Access Tools and want business insights:

```javascript
// Instead of raw data access
const rawData = await client.callTool("census_fetchIndustryData", params);

// Use business analysis for processed insights
const insights = await client.callTool("industry_data", {
  industry_id: "manufacturing",
  include_trends: true
});
```

### From Business Analysis to Data Access
If you need more control over data processing:

```javascript
// Instead of processed insights
const insights = await client.callTool("market_size", params);

// Use raw data access for custom processing
const rawData = await client.callTool("census_fetchMarketSize", {
  naicsCode: "23",
  geography: "us:1"
});
```
